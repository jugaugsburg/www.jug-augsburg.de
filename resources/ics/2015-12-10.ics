SUMMARY:The Feel of Kotlin
DESCRIPTION:Kotlin is a new programming language currently in development a
 t JetBrains\, targeting the JVM and JavaScript platforms. Kotlin's design i
 s heavily focused on pragmatism and interoperability\, providing an alterna
 tive to Java which is more safe\, concise and productive\, while maintainin
 g the same performance and tooling quality. \nAt JetBrains\, we've been usi
 ng Kotlin for a while now\, both for the development of the language itself
  and for other projects\, and we've already gained a significant amount of 
 experience with it. In this talk\, I will introduce the key features of Kot
 lin\, in light of that experience: showing how Kotlin helps you improve you
 r the day-to-day development process and the design of the code that you wr
 ite. \nDieser Talk findet in Englisch statt!
